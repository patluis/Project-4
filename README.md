EC530 Project 4
## Phase 1: Queueing System 
I have chosen to create a queueing system with 3 processes working at once since I decided this would work best to text out the system.
## Phase 2: Speech to Text
For this phase of the project I have decided to use python in order to transcribe audio files to text. I then added these files into the queueing system.
